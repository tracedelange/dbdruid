# ReuBeen v1.1

### What's new?

Howdy team,

As I should have expected, the 1.0 release revealed quite a few deficiencies of what I has assumed was a production ready app. Over the last two weeks I've added some quality of life changes, fixing bugs and implementing some of the more straight forward feature requests. Here's the full changelog: 


### New Features:
- Added public vs private account election on user signup
- Added a screen to show likes and dislikes on log, can be accessed by holding down like / dislike button
- Added push notifications for new comments left on previously commented posts
- Added back button support for several pages to make navigation more obvious
- Added the ability to tag friends on log posts
- Added the ability to update existing logs, changing pictures, content, rating or tagged friends. 
- Added the ability to remove friendships
- Added bio and display name, can be configured in user settings screen
- Added photo delete confirmation when ad-hoc photos are taken during log creation

### Enhancements:
- Increased size of log feed image, moving profile banner above post image
- Made friends list load on demand
- Standardized some styling updates across app, moving towards smaller / non-reactive font sizes for better accessability across platforms
- Adjusted user serializers to minimize user payload from server and optimized user attachment count method

### Bug fixes:
- Fixed user record page not reloading after friend request accepted
- Fixed notifications being created for users commenting on their own logs
- Removed extra character from Homemade log push notification
- Adjusted recommended user list to prevent friends and authed user from appearing

Thanks to all who have downloaded and redownloaded due to mysterious bugs. I appreciate you all. 

If you have any feature requests, please let me know!

Keep crushing those sandwiches,

Trace
