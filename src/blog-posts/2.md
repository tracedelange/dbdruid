## Reubeen 1.0.19 and The Sandwich Classification Problem

Hi team,

I recently pushed version 1.0.19 of Reubeen after a couple weeks of intermittent dev work. Notable changes as follows:
- Redesign of user profile page, showing a link to view user logs, images and **lists**.
- Added Lists! I once asked reddit where I could find the best Reuben in town and was inundated with suggestions. The lists feature allows you to create a public or private lists of sandwiches, each list entry consisting of a type of sandwich to be enjoyed at a specific location. These lists can be edited on the fly and display a percentage of completion when viewed.
- Paid some dude $10 on fiver to design a new pixel art logo for the app. I've gone ahead and added this in various places including this sick breath effect which can be seen at the bottom of this page. 
- Did some redesign on friend requests, friend request acceptance, viewing existing friendships, user look-up and contacts display.

With this release, I'm feeling closer than ever to an apple submission. There are a few small items that I want to adjust before going for it, but for the most part I think we're pretty close.

There is one issue which I've been brainstorming on ways to address, and that's the sandwich classifications. At present, there are about 18 types of sandwiches to choose from, many of which vary greatly in resolution. For example, one option is *BLT*, now, you know a BLT when you see one and there is even some room to explore that genre a little. Another option is a *Dog*, again pretty clear, if it's between two buns and looks like a hotdog you're golden. But what about a *Hamburger*. That's pretty damn broad. There's a lot of room for interpretation between diferent types of sandwiches... and as a friend recently pointed out:  *Wraps are not sandwiches...* news to me.


Hey ChatGPT, please describe 5-10 categories which describe every type of sandwich:

Bread type: The type of bread used for the sandwich, such as white bread, whole wheat bread, bagel, croissant, etc.

Fillings: The ingredients used to fill the sandwich, such as meat, cheese, vegetables, spreads, sauces, etc.

Preparation method: The way the sandwich is prepared, such as grilled, toasted, cold, etc.

Culture or origin: The cultural or regional origin of the sandwich, such as Italian, Mexican, American, etc.

Serving style: The way the sandwich is served, such as a wrap, a panini, an open-faced sandwich, etc.

Meat type: The type of meat used in the sandwich, such as beef, pork, chicken, turkey, etc.

Vegetarian or vegan: Whether the sandwich is suitable for a vegetarian or vegan diet, and the type of plant-based fillings used.

Spiciness level: The level of spiciness in the sandwich, such as mild, medium, hot, etc.

Sauce or dressing: The type of sauce or dressing used to enhance the flavor of the sandwich, such as mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, etc.

Toppings: Additional ingredients used to top the sandwich, such as lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc.


Hmm... there is some merit to those ideas. 



Anyways, what I'm trying to say here is that there needs to be a line drawn between different types of sandwiches, the less subjective the better.

Never met a sandwich I couldn't eat!
