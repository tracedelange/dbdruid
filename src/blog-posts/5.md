# ReuBeen v1.3

### What's new?
The social update! From the start I was always unsatisfied with how friend requests and whatnot were handled in the app. This update is a total UI social overhaul, along with some updates and other random quality of life items to increase usability.

### Enhancements:
- Navigation enhancement. Notably, the ability to navigate to a user from anywhere in the app and return to the previous state via header back button.
- Friend management overhaul
- User profile data caching
- Styling updates
- Tons of performance increases, decreasing API payload size in almost all uses
- Upgraded image rendering using latest Expo-Image package
- Decreased quality of image upload to make storage and download less expensive 

### Bug fixes:
- Image upload issues on Android. 
- Comment input sizing
- Tons of random small fixes
- Various text input length limits, no bee movie scripts as comments here


As always, if you have any feature requests, please let me know.

Keep smashing sammies,

Trace
